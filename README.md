## 📊 Project Overview

This repository contains all code, documentation, and analysis for a statistical study investigating key risk factors for diabetes using R. The project utilizes a cleaned dataset of 100,000 individuals and applies logistic regression and chi-square tests to evaluate associations between diabetes and variables such as BMI, age, smoking history, and gender.

## 🔬 Objectives

- Analyze how **BMI, age, gender,** and **smoking history** affect diabetes risk.
- Use **logistic regression** and **chi-square tests** for statistical analysis.
- Build a **full multivariable logistic regression model** for diabetes prediction.
- Evaluate model performance and interpret risk indicators.

---

## 🧪 Hypotheses Tested

1. **Higher BMI** is associated with increased likelihood of diabetes.
2. **Smoking history** affects the risk of diabetes.
3. **Older individuals** have a higher risk of diabetes.
4. **Diabetes prevalence** differs by gender.

## 💻 Tools & Libraries

- Language: **R**
- Libraries: `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `caret`, `vcd`, `lsr`
- Techniques: Logistic Regression, Chi-square test, Odds Ratio, Cramér's V

---

## 📈 Results Summary

- **BMI & Age** showed the strongest positive association with diabetes (OR = 1.086 and 1.050 respectively).
- **Smoking history** and **gender** were also significant, though with small effect sizes.
- The final model had an **accuracy of 89.1%**, showing strong predictive capability.

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Prevention strategies should prioritize **weight control and early screening for older adults**.
- Although smoking and gender had smaller effect sizes, they are still valuable in comprehensive risk profiling.
